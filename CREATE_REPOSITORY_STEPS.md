# Create GitHub Repository - Step by Step

Since the setup script is running and waiting for the repository to be created, here are the exact steps to create your GitHub repository:

## 🚀 Quick Steps to Create Repository

### Step 1: Sign in to GitHub
1. Go to: **https://github.com/login**
2. Sign in with your `naveenraj44125-creator` account credentials

### Step 2: Create New Repository
1. After signing in, click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner
2. Select **"New repository"**
3. Fill in the repository details:

```
Repository name: github-actions-lightsail-demo
Description: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for AWS Lightsail deployment
Visibility: ✅ Public (for GitHub Actions free tier)
Initialize: ❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"
           ❌ DO NOT add .gitignore
           ❌ DO NOT choose a license
```

### Step 3: Create Repository
1. Click **"Create repository"**
2. You'll see a page with setup instructions
3. **IGNORE** the setup instructions on that page (we already have our code ready)

### Step 4: Return to Terminal
1. Come back to your terminal where the setup script is running
2. Press **Enter** when prompted "Press Enter when you've created the repository on GitHub..."
3. The script will automatically push all the code to your new repository

## 🎯 What Happens Next

After creating the repository and continuing the script:

1. **Code Push**: All project files will be pushed to GitHub
2. **Repository URL**: https://github.com/naveenraj44125-creator/github-actions-lightsail-demo
3. **GitHub Actions**: The CI/CD pipeline will be ready (but won't run until you set up AWS credentials)

## 🔧 After Repository Creation

Once the repository is created and code is pushed, you'll need to:

1. **Set up AWS credentials** (the script will guide you)
2. **Configure GitHub Secrets** for AWS access
3. **Deploy infrastructure** with Terraform
4. **Test the deployment** by pushing code changes

## 📋 Repository Settings to Verify

After creation, your repository should have:
- ✅ Public visibility
- ✅ No README, .gitignore, or license (we provide our own)
- ✅ Empty repository ready for our code push

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Don't initialize** with README/gitignore/license
- **Keep it public** for free GitHub Actions
- **Repository name must be exactly**: `github-actions-lightsail-demo`
- **The script is waiting** for you to create this repository
