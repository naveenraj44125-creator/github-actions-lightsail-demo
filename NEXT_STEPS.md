# 🚀 GitHub Actions + Lightsail Demo - Next Steps

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

1. **✅ Created GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/naveenraj44125-creator/github-actions-lightsail-demo
2. **✅ Pushed Complete Project**: All files including GitHub Actions workflow, Node.js app, Terraform infrastructure, and documentation
3. **✅ Configured Git Authentication**: Using your Personal Access Token

## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete the Demo

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets for AWS Deployment

You need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository for the CI/CD pipeline to work:

1. Go to: https://github.com/naveenraj44125-creator/github-actions-lightsail-demo/settings/secrets/actions

2. Click "New repository secret" and add these secrets:

   - **Name**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
     **Value**: Your AWS Access Key ID (from Ada/AWS CLI)

   - **Name**: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
     **Value**: Your AWS Secret Access Key (from Ada/AWS CLI)

   - **Name**: `LIGHTSAIL_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
     **Value**: Your SSH private key content (will be generated when you create infrastructure)

### Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform

```bash
# Navigate to terraform directory
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan the deployment (review what will be created)
terraform plan

# Apply the infrastructure (creates Lightsail instance, security groups, etc.)
terraform apply
```

This will create:
- AWS Lightsail instance (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Static IP address
- Security groups (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
- SSH key pair for deployment

### Step 3: Configure SSH Key in GitHub Secrets

After running `terraform apply`, you'll get an SSH private key. Add it to GitHub Secrets:

1. Copy the private key output from Terraform
2. Go to GitHub Secrets: https://github.com/naveenraj44125-creator/github-actions-lightsail-demo/settings/secrets/actions
3. Add secret named `LIGHTSAIL_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` with the private key content

### Step 4: Test the Complete CI/CD Pipeline

1. Make a small change to the app (e.g., edit `app/server.js`)
2. Commit and push the change:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test deployment pipeline"
   git push
   ```
3. Watch the GitHub Actions workflow run: https://github.com/naveenraj44125-creator/github-actions-lightsail-demo/actions

## 🔍 What the Pipeline Does

1. **Test**: Runs Jest tests for the Node.js application
2. **Build**: Creates production build and Docker image
3. **Deploy**: 
   - Connects to Lightsail instance via SSH
   - Pulls latest code
   - Installs dependencies
   - Restarts the application service
   - Runs health checks

## 📊 Monitoring and Verification

After deployment, you can:

1. **Check Application**: Visit `http://YOUR_LIGHTSAIL_IP:3000`
2. **Health Check**: Visit `http://YOUR_LIGHTSAIL_IP:3000/health`
3. **View Logs**: SSH into instance and check logs
4. **GitHub Actions**: Monitor deployment status in Actions tab

## 🛠 Useful Commands

```bash
# Check local application
npm test                    # Run tests
npm start                   # Start locally
./scripts/test-local.sh     # Full local test

# Infrastructure management
cd terraform
terraform plan              # Preview changes
terraform apply             # Deploy infrastructure
terraform destroy           # Clean up resources

# SSH to Lightsail instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/lightsail-key ubuntu@YOUR_LIGHTSAIL_IP
```

## 🎯 Demo Features

- **Automated Testing**: Jest unit tests in CI pipeline
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible deployments
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Rolling updates with health checks
- **Security**: SSH key-based authentication, security groups
- **Monitoring**: Health endpoints and deployment verification
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage guides

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **AWS Costs**: Lightsail instances cost ~$3.50-$5/month
2. **Security**: Never commit AWS credentials or SSH keys to Git
3. **Cleanup**: Run `terraform destroy` when done to avoid charges
4. **Region**: Default is `us-east-1`, modify in `terraform/variables.tf` if needed

## 🆘 Need Help?

- Check the logs in GitHub Actions if deployment fails
- Review Terraform output for infrastructure issues
- SSH into the Lightsail instance to debug application issues
- All configuration is in the repository for easy troubleshooting
